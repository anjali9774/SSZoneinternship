🚀 Excited to unveil my latest project on LinkedIn: "Grillis - Restaurant Website"!

✨ **Overview:** I've just completed crafting a delightful restaurant website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This simple yet elegant webpage features a header, navigation menu, content section, and footer, all designed to provide a seamless experience for users. Plus, it's fully responsive, ensuring it looks fantastic and functions flawlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

🍽️ **Features:**
- **Menu Showcase:** Presenting a mouthwatering menu that highlights our restaurant's culinary delights.
- **Interactive Reservation System:** Offering patrons the convenience of booking a table online with just a few clicks.
- **Engaging Gallery:** Showcasing tantalizing images of our restaurant's ambiance and delectable dishes.

🎨 **Visual Appeal:**
- I've employed basic styling techniques to elevate the aesthetics of the webpage, ensuring it's visually appealing and inviting to visitors.


 I have taken the website reference from @codewithsaddie.
